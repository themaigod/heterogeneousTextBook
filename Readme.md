| [MixSp: A Framework for Embedding Heterogeneous Information Networks With Arbitrary Number of Node and Edge Types](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9046288) | IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering | 2021 |                                                                                     It  argues that the objective of heterogeneous network embedding is to explicitly model the heterogeneities of different node and edge types while embedding the network structure, but the network-specific modeling would limit the applicability.                                                                                      | So its solution is to jointly learn two kinds of representations, including each separate single edge type subgraph and the the graph without considering heterogeneity. |

Meta-paths are highly correlated, and their common part exposes intrinsic factors of nodes which absorb informative characteristic from all meta-paths and could more essentially reflect the characteristics.<br/>2. Meta-paths describe distinguished sub-structures from various aspects, and their specific parts sometimes interfere with the analysis of nodes once connections along meta path are sparse or noisy. |                                                        1. generate the node embeddings for each meta path<br/>2.                                                         |
