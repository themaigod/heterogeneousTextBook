For ARs where the nodes share similar properties, we calculate euclidean distance as the proximity between nodes, so as to make the nodes directly close in the low-dimensional space. <br/> 2. On the other hand, for IRs which bridge two compatible nodes, we model them as translations between the nodes and calculate translation-based distance as the proximity between nodes                                                                                             |       HIN embedding       |

ConCH employs meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects. ConCH co-derives object embeddings and context embeddings via graph convolution. It also uses the attention mechanism to fuse such embeddings.                                                                                                                                                                                       |       HIN embedding       |

So it suggests to use contrastive learning to solve this problem. This will face three problems:<br/> 1. How to design a heterogeneous contrastive mechanism <br/> 2. How to select proper views in a HIN <br/> 3.  How to set a difficult contrastive task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                               two views of a HIN (network schema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed to generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the performance of HeCo                                                                                                               |       HIN embedding       |

How can multihop neighbors’ information be efficiently aggregated<br/>  However, previous studies have shown that although the stacking of multilayer GNNs can aggregate multihop neighbor nodes in a transitional manner, simply increasing layers of the networks will bring about problems such as the vanishing gradient and oversmoothing<br/> 2. How can multihop neighbors be autonomously extracted under heterogeneous relations <br/> it cannot efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood semantic information. This limitation will be verified in our experiments<br/> 3. How can multilevel information of neighbors be comprehensively integrated<br/> At present, most metapath-based heterogeneous graph representation methods only focus on the node information at the two ends of the metapath and ignore the information of the intermediate ones in the path. However, such information is also important for representing learning. | we propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to efficiently extract multihop hybrid neighbors. Then, we formulate a hop-level heterogeneous information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is constructed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood information. In this fashion, this paper solves the problem of aggregating multihop neighborhood information and learning hybrid metapaths for target tasks. This mitigates the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information present at different levels. |       HIN embedding       |

Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                    a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations                                                                                                    |       HIN embedding       |
